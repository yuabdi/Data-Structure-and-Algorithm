Answers:
1. If there is no hint, the guess will be taking the  longer road at the most worst case is 10. In this situation the user guesses: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.

2. At the case is hin, the user could guess the middle number like 5. When the user hint is lower, the secret is in [1:4]. Or, the secret is [6:1]. If the gues is not correct, the range numers of search is reduced to a half. However, the number of guess is log2(10) ~4

At the case, the secret number is 7.

User guesse number is middle which 5, the ranger of search is [6:10].
User guesse number is middle which 8, the ranger of search is [6:7].
User guesse number is middle which 2, the ranger of search is [7].
At the end, user guesses 7
